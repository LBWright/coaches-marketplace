# Problems and Solutions
Coaches are people who ask powerful questions to those who want to make change. There are several types of coaches. The following are common coaches: 
* Small Business and Startup coaches
* Enterprise and Corporate coaches
* Life and Personal growth coaches
* Transitional coaches
* Fitness coaches
* Religious coaches

Coaches are not experts in any particular area, but instead, ask good questions to help the coachee (person being coached) understand their problems better and talk through solutions for those problems.
As coaching rises in popularity, there are an increase in the number of resources that coaches need.

Coaching requires a licensing (though anyone can actually coach without a license). Part of obtaining this licensing, in addition to hours of classes, are *paid* hours of coaching.
There are 3 levels of licensing. For the first level, coaches need 75 hours of *paid* coaching. For the second level, I think they need 500. For the 3rd, I think they need 2500.

A common way for coaches to obtain these hours, especially in the first level, is to 'barter' with other coaches to get their hours.

The way that bartering works is that coaches will coach each other in order to get their hours. This is beneficial to both parties because it allows them to practice but also helps them understand how different coaches work.

Our software would provide a place for coaches to connect with each other to offer these bartering services with each other.
A good way for coaches to practice, is to coach people through specific issues. Our categories will allow other coaches, at a glance, see what someone needs to be coached through. If that coach wants to practice coaching through that issue, or the coaching relationship seems like a good fit, then the coaches will be able to connect and work some sort of coaches agreement (usually in terms of 4 to 6 week cycles).

We will provide our coaches with the ability to log and take notes on these coaching calls. 

We won't need to get in touch with the International Coaching Federation for any reason as they are very hands off in their licensing process except for training/teaching, which we won't have anything to do with.
