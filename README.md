# Coaches Marketplace
A marketplace for coaches to barter for coaching

# General Idea
A user will be able to log into their account to create a 'listing' to barter with other coaches for coaching. Another coach can click that listing to get in contact with coach that posted it. It will set up conversation between the two of them to arrange a coaching agreement. The application will also act as a convenient way to log bartered coaching data.
